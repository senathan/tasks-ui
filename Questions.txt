why you want to join the Expert Engineer Programme and what do you hope to get out of it?

I want to join the Expert Engineer Programme because it matches the direction I naturally grew into over the years. I enjoy solving real problems, building tools that save time for others, and sharing what I learn with the team. This programme will give me a chance to do that on a bigger scale, with the right support and the right people around me.

I’m also looking for a space where I can learn from other strong engineers, improve the way I think about architecture and long-term design, and sharpen the areas where I want to grow, like AI-driven automation and cloud engineering.

Most of my work, like the Evergreening automation, started with a simple goal — make life easier for the team. Through this programme, I want to take that mindset further, contribute to wider engineering standards, and help build solutions that benefit more than just my immediate team.

In short, I hope to grow technically, think bigger, and make a meaningful impact across teams, not just in my own area.

How did you cater for different capabilities and mindsets in your team?

Every team has different learning speeds and comfort zones. Some members love automation; others prefer manual control because it feels safer. I spent time showing quick wins — like saving two hours in a task — to help them see the value.

I also adjusted how I explained things: visual diagrams for some, hands-on sessions for others. That mix of approaches built confidence and helped everyone find their way to contribute.

How do you keep learning and staying up to date?

I follow a simple rule — learn, try, and teach. Whenever I find a new tool or concept, I test it in a small personal project, and if it works, I share it with my team.

Recently, I completed AWS certification and explored AI-driven automation tools. Sharing that knowledge through internal demos keeps me learning faster and builds a growth culture in the team.

How did you decide on the tools and technologies for this automation?

I chose Jenkins because it was already part of our CI/CD ecosystem — that made adoption easier. Maven and Gradle were supported across all projects, so I built scripts that could handle both.

Integrating Jira gave traceability for management, and using batch jobs allowed flexible scheduling. My goal was always to use existing infrastructure smartly, not reinvent the wheel.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did you ensure the project delivered successfully under pressure?

I kept three principles: focus, traceability, and small wins.
Focus: We defined clear scope — first automating core APIs before expanding.
Traceability: Everything was tied to Jira tickets for accountability.
Small wins: We rolled out to one repo, proved the value, and then scaled.
This approach built confidence and avoided overloading the team.
