## ðŸ”¹ **Individual Objectives**

### **1. ATM Deliveries**

In 2025, I took a leading role in delivering ATM initiatives with minimal support, closely coordinating with Hardeep and engaging with the ATM delivery, stack, and testing teams. I successfully delivered key components including P2, vulnerability-related Remote Rebuild enhancements, and mTLS-enabled Cert-Renewal APIs in Q1.

Root CA rotation and other central certificate renewals were completed timely, maintaining compliance and operational stability. I implemented dynamic secrets management (e.g., image pull secrets and promotion credentials) that supports seamless rotation based on TTL expiryâ€”ensuring zero manual intervention.

I also led the ELK migration to a new cluster and delivered an intermediate mTLS tactical solution in the Remote Rebuild service, achieving zero defects. The Windows Server 2019â€“2022 UAT migration was completed successfully. I remained consistently ahead of schedule in planning MTP activities with Nicola for 2026.

A major highlight was the PROD one-click deployment, which was completed with zero disruptionâ€”demonstrating operational maturity and resilience. I ensured all components met resilience standards and avoided any ORACs throughout the year.

### **2. Application Evergreen Update**

I played a key role in implementing, educating, and onboarding the Application Evergreen component across all internal projects. It now secures most applicationsâ€”especially ATM and GMR UIâ€”by automating patching and reducing manual maintenance. The component has run smoothly throughout the year, with no reported issues. Feature expansion is planned for a future phase.

---

### **3. ATM Certificate Renewal Service Migration (Windows â†’ aPaaS v4)**

I implemented an mTLS tactical solution in the Remote Rebuild service, which performed reliably without issues. The Windows 2019 to 2022 migration in UAT was completed successfully. The full migration of the Certificate Renewal Service to aPaaS v4 is planned for mid-2026 and is currently on track.

---

### **4. Cloud-WAF Application Development (Akamai Onboarding Automation)**

I led the design and onboarding automation for the Akamai Cloud-WAF project. This included creating wireframes, defining the database design, coordinating UI efforts with Hardeep, and running team brainstorming sessions. I analyzed Akamai APIs to support requirement understanding and cross-functionally contributed to both UI and batch layers.

I implemented a Spring Batch solution to improve performance and reliability, collaborated across dependencies, and coordinated with stakeholders to ensure full requirement coverage. I also supported team members by offering technical input and driving efficient delivery.

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Global Objectives**

### **1. Precision in Operations, Risk Management, and Controls**

I ensured all production releases were well-planned, thoroughly tested, and backed by clear design documents. I maintained strong communication with stakeholders and ensured all relevant documentation was up to date.

I proactively escalated financial or technical risks and focused on cost-effective solutions. I adhered to secure coding practices, PR reviews, and repeatable automation through Evergreen deployments. Prioritization of work was always aligned with ResCat categorization and on-time delivery.

---

### **2. Drive Simplicity and Efficiency, Seek Every Opportunity to Automate**

I never missed any mandatory training and made good use of Pluralsight to upskill, progressing in advanced MongoDB and Node.js courses. I enhanced automation pipelines, including GitLab CI/CD for Cloud-WAF (UI and Batch), and helped teammates implement similar solutions.

I also participated actively in technical discussions and supported colleagues via chat and troubleshooting. I enrolled in the Staff Engineer Excellence Programme 2025 cohort to strengthen my leadership and technical delivery.

---

### **3. Focus on Businesses and Projects Where We Can Excel**

I successfully delivered CSM IRIS and Fierce components as an individual contributor with zero defects and on-time delivery. I remediated all vulnerabilities in ATM and CSM UI estates within SLA and shared mitigation plans promptly with respective teams.

I ensured no components triggered ORACs and maintained a high level of operational maturity across services.

---

### **4. Promote Diversity of Thought and Challenge the Status Quo**

I led design initiatives for the Akamai Cloud-WAF project and worked closely with Hardeep and Daniel across UI and Batch implementations. I presented the Evergreen component during a SETS weekly session, sharing insights on its flow, benefits, limitations, and future roadmapâ€”encouraging open dialogue and innovation.

---

### **5. Provide World-Class Service to Customers and Clients**

I managed two key CSM UI modules as an individual contributor, aligning efforts to a fixed delivery bandwidth of 1.5 days per week. All ATM releases were delivered on time and with high qualityâ€”no production issues reported. I remain highly responsive to the RTB team and consistently deliver ahead of deadlines across projects, including Cloud-WAF.
