### Part 1 ‚Äì Polaris (2011): Learning How to Learn

When I look back at my journey, my biggest growth started in 2011, when I joined Polaris Financial Technology. I was fresh into the IT world, and honestly, I felt like a newborn fish dropped into the sea without knowing how to swim. Everything around me was new ‚Äî the office environment, the work culture, the expectations, and the technology. I was nervous and unsure about how I would survive, let alone grow. I remember walking into the office on my first day, looking at screens full of code, and feeling completely lost. At that time, I didn‚Äôt even know where to start.

What made the difference for me was the leader I worked with. He was very different from what I expected. Most new employees hope for a leader who will sit with them, explain tasks step by step, and guide them through every challenge. My leader did the opposite. He avoided giving me ready-made answers. Whenever I went to him with a problem, he would ask me first, ‚ÄúDid you try to understand this on your own?‚Äù His rule was very simple: I had to research the problem, try to get at least 1% of understanding, and write down on paper what I thought I would achieve by the end of the task. Only then could I go back to him for guidance.

At first, this was very frustrating for me. I used to think, ‚ÄúWhy is he not helping me? Why can‚Äôt he just tell me the answer and make my life easy?‚Äù But slowly, I started to see the point. By forcing me to try on my own first, he was teaching me to analyse the problem. He wanted me to break the problem into small parts, do a little research, and think before I acted. This habit of writing things down ‚Äî what I know, what I don‚Äôt know, and what I expect as the outcome ‚Äî became a turning point for me. It gave me a structured way of thinking. Instead of panicking when I saw something new, I now had a method to start small, build my understanding step by step, and then reach a solution.

This was not an easy change. There were days when I struggled, when I felt like I was wasting time researching without moving forward. But over time, I saw that this approach was making me more confident. Whenever a new task came my way, I no longer felt helpless. I knew I could at least begin by writing down what I understood and what I needed to learn. That small 1% of knowledge became the seed that grew into full solutions. The more I practiced this, the better I became at handling unknown problems.

One strong example I remember from those days was when I was asked to look into a module I had never worked on before. My first reaction was fear ‚Äî I had no idea where to begin. Following my leader‚Äôs method, I spent some hours just reading through documentation, looking at the code, and making small notes. I drew a simple diagram on paper about how I thought the system worked and wrote down what my final outcome should be. When I went back to my leader, he didn‚Äôt correct me directly. Instead, he asked me questions that guided me to refine my understanding. By the end of the week, I was able to make progress on the module, and I felt a huge sense of achievement. That moment made me realise that learning is not about being given answers; it is about building the ability to find them yourself.

The result of this practice was that I became much more independent. My leader did not have to spend hours handholding me, which also freed his time for bigger responsibilities. I was able to pick up tasks faster and deliver them with more confidence. For the team, this meant fewer delays, because I was not waiting for someone to explain everything. I could move forward on my own and then validate with others when needed. This small shift created a big impact: I became a reliable team member who could handle challenges, even as a fresher.

More importantly, this experience built the foundation for my career. The habit of analysing problems, starting with small understanding, and writing down my goals has stayed with me till today. Whether I am working on a new technology, a complex project, or even mentoring others, I still use the same method. It has become my personal formula for learning and problem solving. Many times later in my career, when I faced complex situations with clients or new technologies, I remembered those early lessons at Polaris. Without that training, I may have continued to depend too much on others. With it, I built confidence that I could always figure things out, no matter how tough they looked at the beginning.

Looking back, Polaris was not just my first job; it was the place where I learnt how to learn. That was the biggest gift I could have received at that stage of my career. It shaped my thinking, gave me a method to approach problems, and set me on a path of continuous growth. If I had to describe my learning in simple words, I would say: it taught me to swim in the sea of challenges instead of waiting for someone to carry me.

### 1. Coordinating with Multiple Stakeholders to Meet a Tight Deadline

A while back, I was assigned to lead a crucial module in a new project for a well-known client. Although I had previously worked with this client, the rest of my team hadn‚Äôt. This gave me a unique advantage ‚Äî I understood the client‚Äôs expectations, communication style, and standards. But since my team members were new to both the client and the project scope, I had to play a key role in bridging that gap.

The timeline was tight, and the expectations were very clear. We couldn‚Äôt afford any confusion or delays. So I took the initiative to explain the client‚Äôs business and technical requirements in simple terms to the team. I also created a safe space for open discussions. Some team members were hesitant to speak in large meetings, so I made sure to have one-on-one conversations where they could ask questions freely and share any concerns. That helped build trust and gave everyone more confidence.

One of the biggest challenges was to make sure our team discussions were focused and productive. I noticed some meetings would go off-track or become too detailed. So I introduced a new format for team syncs ‚Äî we used checklists, clear agendas, and time-boxed discussions. We focused on decisions, blockers, and updates. This brought more clarity and reduced confusion.

Another important step I took was preparing the team before client meetings. I guided them on how to ask the right questions and present updates in a way that aligned with the client‚Äôs expectations. This helped build our credibility. The client saw us as a team that not only understood their business but also delivered solutions that fit their needs.

Despite the tight schedule, we delivered the module on time. The client appreciated our professionalism, and my teammates felt more confident about working in similar high-pressure environments. This experience showed me that strong communication and clear direction are just as important as technical skill when it comes to delivering results as a team.

**Impact:** This approach led to on-time delivery, strengthened the client relationship, and improved my team‚Äôs confidence and capability for future projects.

### 2. Solving a Technical Problem with High Project Impact

In one of our projects, we had a consistent problem where developers were spending too much time manually upgrading dependencies in Java APIs to fix vulnerabilities flagged by tools like Veracode and Prisma. These issues popped up frequently, and fixing them manually across multiple services was taking a toll on developer time and slowing down release cycles. It was repetitive, time-consuming, and error-prone ‚Äî especially as the number of APIs and microservices in our environment increased.

I decided to tackle this by building something more sustainable. I designed and implemented an ‚Äúevergreen‚Äù automation component that could automatically upgrade project dependencies in POM and Gradle files as per the latest security standards. The idea was to take the manual effort out of the equation and reduce the chances of human error.

I built this as part of a Jenkins pipeline, which could be triggered regularly or manually based on team preferences. The pipeline scanned the current dependencies, checked for newer versions with security patches, and then applied those updates in a structured way. It even handled version compatibility issues by running validations post-upgrade. I tested this thoroughly and rolled it out in phases, starting with smaller projects.

Eventually, this component was adopted by many development teams across the organization, especially in the MKD and SEtS teams. It became a core utility in our CI/CD process, saving countless hours of manual effort and ensuring we stayed compliant with security standards.

**Impact:** This automation led to faster patching of vulnerabilities, improved overall code quality, and saved dozens of developer hours every sprint ‚Äî making the delivery cycle more secure and efficient across multiple teams.

### 3. Overcoming a Technical Challenge That Threatened Delivery

There was a time when our release schedule was under serious threat due to the Spring4Shell vulnerability. This security issue had just been reported globally, and it directly impacted our application stack. The risk was huge ‚Äî attackers could potentially take control of our servers. The challenge was not just technical but also strategic because our release was already scheduled, and any delay would affect the business timeline. At the same time, going live without fixing the issue would expose the system to major security risks.

I knew we had to act fast. I immediately halted work on the current sprint stories and gathered a small team of experienced developers and QA engineers. We analyzed the vulnerability, scoped the impact on our project, and came up with a mitigation plan. We updated our Spring dependencies, fixed affected modules, and re-ran all functional and regression tests to ensure nothing broke.

But that wasn‚Äôt enough ‚Äî we also needed to make sure our changes wouldn‚Äôt cause downstream issues for other teams or integrated services. So I coordinated closely with our DevOps and integration teams to validate the patch in all connected environments. I also communicated regularly with business stakeholders, explaining the risk in simple terms, so they understood why this fix had to take priority.

Thanks to the team‚Äôs focused effort, we were able to resolve the vulnerability and complete the release on time. The delivery was seamless, with no outages or issues after going live. The client appreciated our quick action and transparency during the situation.

**Impact:** Our quick and effective response not only protected the organization from a critical security threat but also allowed us to meet our original delivery timeline, maintaining stakeholder trust and compliance.

### 4. Quickly Learning a New Technology to Solve a Problem

During a project migration from apaas v3 to v4, we faced a unique challenge. The existing CI/CD pipeline had been designed by another team and had several custom scripts and logic that didn‚Äôt align with our team's best practices. When the ownership moved to our team, we had to rewrite the entire pipeline using our CSO-compliant standards ‚Äî but the tricky part was that I had no prior experience with Groovy scripting, HELM charts, or even apaas v4-specific deployment configurations.

Initially, I reached out to the DevOps team for support, but they were tied up with other high-priority projects. I knew the delivery timelines were tight, so instead of waiting around, I decided to take ownership and upskill myself. I spent late nights learning Groovy, digging into Jenkins pipeline logic, and experimenting with HELM values. I also read the existing pipeline scripts line by line to understand what they were doing, then started rewriting them in a more modular and maintainable format.

After a week of intense focus, I had a working pipeline that passed all required checks and successfully deployed the application to apaas v4. Not only was the pipeline delivered on time, but I also helped my teammates ‚Äî some of whom were also new to this ecosystem ‚Äî by sharing tips and walkthroughs.

The pipeline has been running in production since June 2023 without any major issues. It‚Äôs now being used as a reference model for other projects going through a similar migration.

**Impact:** This self-initiated learning and execution ensured project timelines were met, reduced the team‚Äôs dependency on DevOps, and established a reusable standard for future migrations.

### 5. Explaining Complex Technical Concepts to Non-Technical Stakeholders

In one project, after deploying to the production environment, a serious issue was discovered that impacted user functionality. It was something our testing team should‚Äôve ideally caught during the QA phase, but unfortunately, it slipped through. As the project lead, I had to manage both the technical resolution and the communication with the client ‚Äî who were not technical but heavily impacted by the issue.

I quickly gathered the technical team to analyze the root cause and found that a misconfigured environment setting had caused the issue. We fixed it in staging and tested it thoroughly. But the bigger challenge was to communicate this clearly and transparently to the client.

I scheduled a call and explained the issue using non-technical terms. I compared the problem to a traffic light system being misconfigured ‚Äî everything else was working, but the coordination was off. I reassured them that the issue was resolved and explained the preventive steps we were implementing, such as improved automated checks and stronger UAT validations.

I also acknowledged the oversight and took accountability, which helped build trust. The client appreciated the honest explanation and the corrective steps. They even praised the team for reacting quickly and professionally.

**Impact:** The situation strengthened the client relationship despite the issue, showed our integrity and reliability, and led to better QA processes for future deployments.

### 6. Learning Experience That Changed My Professional Path

During the CAK project, we were migrating infrastructure to apaas v4. One major challenge was related to how client applications connected to secure URLs for certificate provisioning. These URLs couldn‚Äôt be changed easily, as they were hardcoded in the apps and updating them would require time-consuming rebuilds. Initially, the plan was to simply redirect all traffic to new v4 endpoints, but that wasn‚Äôt practical.

After several discussions, we decided to use load balancers and VIPs (Virtual IPs) to manage traffic flow from the old URLs to the new infrastructure without needing app rebuilds. This approach was efficient but technically deep ‚Äî involving networking, routing, and HA (high availability) setups, which I wasn‚Äôt fully familiar with at the time.

I took it upon myself to learn the fundamentals of networking ‚Äî how VIPs work, DNS routing, internal load balancer configurations, and SSL passthrough. I engaged with our network team and gradually gained enough understanding to contribute meaningfully to the design discussions.

Eventually, I helped finalize and implement a solution that worked perfectly ‚Äî the client app continued working without a rebuild, while the backend infrastructure got fully migrated. The project was delivered on schedule, with zero user impact.

**Impact:** This hands-on experience made me a better cross-functional developer and gave me valuable networking knowledge, which I‚Äôve applied in multiple DevSecOps projects since.

### 7. Mentoring a Team Member for Career Growth

In one of our recent projects, I was leading a team that included new members unfamiliar with our client‚Äôs expectations and working standards. Two of them were apprentices, just starting out in their careers. While they were technically sound, they lacked exposure to real-world development cycles, coding practices, and client interactions.

I took a mentorship-based approach to help them grow. I started by giving them small but meaningful tasks and paired with them using pair programming sessions. This helped me understand their strengths and learning styles. One apprentice was good at logic but struggled with frontend work, while the other was comfortable with UI but unsure about backend flows. I gave each one tailored assignments to help them build confidence in their weaker areas.

I also encouraged them to participate in client meetings, helping them prepare beforehand and gradually take the lead in presenting their work. When they made mistakes, I treated them as learning moments instead of criticisms. We regularly reviewed code together, and I showed them how to write cleaner, more maintainable code.

Within a few months, both apprentices were confidently contributing to the project. They even took ownership of small modules on their own. Their growth didn‚Äôt go unnoticed ‚Äî they received appreciation from both the client and our internal management.

**Impact:** This mentorship improved project delivery quality, increased team bandwidth, and helped two early-career developers find their confidence and footing in the industry.
