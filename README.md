In 2025, I led several high-impact initiatives across the ATM platform, delivering key enhancements such as vulnerability fixes, mTLS-enabled Cert-Renewal APIs, and dynamic secrets rotation. I successfully managed ELK migration, Windows Server upgrades, and implemented one-click production deployments with zero disruption. I consistently stayed ahead of delivery plans and ensured all components met resilience and compliance standards.

I continued championing the Application Evergreen component across in-house projects, enabling secure, automated patching with no issues reported. As part of the Cloud-WAF onboarding automation, I led solution design, wireframes, and Spring Batch implementation, while actively coordinating with cross-functional teams and stakeholders to ensure complete requirement coverage.

I delivered CSM UI enhancements (IRIS and Fierce) on time and defect-free, and remediated all vulnerabilities within SLA for ATM and CSM estates. I ensured strong documentation, risk management, and stakeholder communication, with a focus on secure and automated delivery.

I improved CI/CD processes using GitLab pipelines and supported others in adopting automation. I also enrolled in the 2025 Staff Engineer Excellence Programme to further enhance my technical leadership.

Through innovation, ownership, and collaboration, Iâ€™ve delivered high-quality results while promoting best practices, technical growth, and world-class service across all projects.
