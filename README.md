Here’s a more polished and clear version of your message you can use for your **Teams chat**:

**Hi everyone,**

Quick decision time — we need to finalise something today for the Diwali event.

Here are the two options:

**Option 1:**
Rajesh got a quote from Lily’s yesterday, and Jignesh also helped with one from his end. Both come to around **£3.50 per box**, which is the minimum we can manage.

Now, here’s the challenge:

* We **can’t collect money from colleagues** directly.
* **Charity funds** also **can’t be reimbursed**.

So, **if everyone is happy to personally contribute**, we can move forward.
For example, if 20 people contribute **£15–£20 each**, we can make around **70 boxes**.
If fewer people contribute, we’ll adjust the count accordingly.
We can also reach out to known contacts via email for support.

**Option 2:**
Cancel the box distribution and instead plan a **proper buffet lunch on October 15th (Wednesday)**.
We can decorate the floor either that day or that week to still keep the festive vibe.

**Please vote** for your preferred option ASAP so we can proceed — we’re short on time.

Thanks, everyone!
