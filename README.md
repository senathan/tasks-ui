Excellent — this is a fantastic foundation for your **Expert Engineer presentation** 👏
You already have the technical depth; we’ll now elevate it into a **story-driven, confident, and structured talk** that connects to your **pillars**:

* Big-picture thinking
* Execution
* Leveling up others

I’ll revamp your entire talk into a **smooth, 5–7 minute version** — clear, human, and professional — so you can present naturally along with your slides.

### 🧍‍♂️ Slide 1: About Me

Hello everyone, I’m **Senthil Nathan**, a backend engineer with over nine years of experience in building Java and cloud-based systems across banking and enterprise domains.

I started my career at **Polaris Financial Technology**, where I learnt how to think through problems rather than rush to solutions. Over the years, I’ve grown through hands-on experience with companies like **Infosys, TCS, and Cognizant**, working on systems for **Citi, Singapore Airlines, ABN AMRO, and Comcast**.

What excites me most is **solving problems that save time and make life easier for others** — through automation, good design, and collaboration. That’s what led me to create the **Application Evergreening Component**, which I’ll be talking about today.

---

### ⚙️ Slide 2: Application Evergreening Component

We all know how **dependency management** can become a painful, time-consuming task as projects grow. Manually checking and upgrading dependencies for every API slows down releases and increases security risk.

To solve this, I designed and implemented an **Application Evergreening Component** — a system that automatically upgrades dependencies for most of our APIs, reducing human effort by 80%.

It’s fully automated through a **Jenkins pipeline** that handles everything — from repository checkout to dependency upgrades, Jira tracking, and pull requests — without manual intervention.

This wasn’t just a technical exercise. The goal was to free developers from repetitive maintenance work so they could focus on innovation, not manual version updates.

---

### 🔍 Slide 3: Approach Overview (Execution Pillar)

Let me walk you through how it works.

Before running the automation, the user provides a few simple inputs — branch name, repository name, whether it’s Maven or Gradle, Jira link, and any dependencies to exclude.

Once the job runs, Jenkins checks out the repo, creates a Jira ticket for traceability, and builds a new branch. Then, a series of scripts identify outdated dependencies and upgrade them automatically.

If updates are found, a pull request is created. If not, a comment is posted in Jira. Either way, the developer knows exactly what happened — **no manual searching, no version mismatch, no wasted hours**.

This process runs in both **Dev and Pre-Prod environments**, ensuring Prisma vulnerability fixes and dependency alignment with minimal effort.

That’s **execution in action** — turning a manual, error-prone process into a repeatable and auditable automation.

---

### 🌍 Slide 4: Big Picture Thinking

Now, if I zoom out — this project wasn’t just about saving hours. It was about changing how we think about maintenance.

Earlier, every team spent hours doing the same repetitive task — upgrading dependencies manually. By automating it, we didn’t just save 20 hours per quarter; we **changed the mindset** from *“let’s fix dependencies”* to *“let’s focus on innovation.”*

This solution also improved **security posture**, because frequent updates meant fewer vulnerable libraries staying in production.

That’s what big-picture thinking means to me — not just solving the task, but solving the *problem behind the problem*.

---

### 👥 Slide 5: Leveling Up Others

No innovation is complete unless it helps others grow.

After building the Evergreening Component, I worked with multiple teams to **train and onboard them** to use it effectively. We created simple documentation and shared sessions on how the Jenkins job works, so anyone could adapt it for their project.

This collaboration helped other SETS teams adopt similar automation patterns for **Python and Docker environments**, multiplying the benefit across the organisation.

Helping others adopt the system also made me a better communicator — I learnt how to explain technical concepts in simpler terms and how to encourage teams to experiment without fear of failure.

That’s what I call **leveling up others** — sharing what you learn so the whole team moves forward together.

---

### 🚀 Slide 6: Challenges and Future Plans

Every automation journey has challenges.

We faced issues with **legacy systems**, where dependency upgrades broke code. Some libraries had complex relationships that caused cascading errors. We also needed strong automated testing to catch issues early.

We handled this by building fallback mechanisms, improving error handling, and adding clear reporting in Jira.

For the **future**, we’re exploring **AI-assisted code refactoring**, where generative AI can automatically identify deprecated APIs and suggest replacements. This will make the upgrade process even smoother and reduce manual intervention further.

The vision is to take this component beyond Java — to Python, Docker, and other ecosystems — creating a common automation framework for dependency management across projects.

---

### 🌟 Slide 7: Closing

So, to summarise — this project reflects three things I deeply believe in:

1. **Big-picture thinking** – seeing how small automations can bring large-scale impact.
2. **Execution** – turning an idea into a working, reliable system.
3. **Leveling up others** – sharing and scaling that learning to help everyone grow.

For me, engineering is not just about writing code. It’s about building things that last, simplify work, and help teams deliver better together.

Thank you for listening — I’m happy to take any questions or feedback.

## 💬 Optional Presenter’s Tip:

If you’re giving this as a live talk:

* **Start with a story** (“I once spent a full day upgrading versions manually…”)
* Use a confident, calm tone when you say “this is where the magic happens” — that’s your hook moment.
* End with a smile when you say, “help teams deliver better together.”

Would you like me to make a **slide deck script version** (with slide-wise short speaker notes) that matches this talk word-for-word? It’ll help you rehearse easily.
