### Part 1 ‚Äì Polaris 2011 Learning How to Learn

When I look back at my journey my biggest growth started in 2011 when I joined Polaris Financial Technology. I was fresh into the IT world and honestly I felt like a newborn fish dropped into the sea without knowing how to swim. Everything around me was new, the office environment, the work culture, the expectations, and the technology. I was nervous and unsure about how I would survive let alone grow. I remember walking into the office on my first day looking at screens full of code and feeling completely lost. At that time I did not even know where to start.

What made the difference for me was the leader I worked with. He was very different from what I expected. Most new employees hope for a leader who will sit with them, explain tasks step by step, and guide them through every challenge. My leader did the opposite. He avoided giving me ready made answers. Whenever I went to him with a problem he would ask me first did you try to understand this on your own. His rule was very simple, I had to research the problem, try to get at least one percent of understanding, and write down on paper what I thought I would achieve by the end of the task. Only then could I go back to him for guidance.

At first this was very frustrating for me. I used to think why is he not helping me, why can he not just tell me the answer and make my life easy. But slowly I started to see the point. By forcing me to try on my own first he was teaching me to analyse the problem. He wanted me to break the problem into small parts, do a little research, and think before I acted. This habit of writing things down, what I know, what I do not know, and what I expect as the outcome, became a turning point for me. It gave me a structured way of thinking. Instead of panicking when I saw something new I now had a method to start small, build my understanding step by step, and then reach a solution.

This was not an easy change. There were days when I struggled, when I felt like I was wasting time researching without moving forward. But over time I saw that this approach was making me more confident. Whenever a new task came my way I no longer felt helpless. I knew I could at least begin by writing down what I understood and what I needed to learn. That small one percent of knowledge became the seed that grew into full solutions. The more I practiced this the better I became at handling unknown problems.

One strong example I remember from those days was when I was asked to look into a module I had never worked on before. My first reaction was fear, I had no idea where to begin. Following my leaders method I spent some hours just reading through documentation, looking at the code, and making small notes. I drew a simple diagram on paper about how I thought the system worked and wrote down what my final outcome should be. When I went back to my leader he did not correct me directly. Instead he asked me questions that guided me to refine my understanding. By the end of the week I was able to make progress on the module and I felt a huge sense of achievement. That moment made me realise that learning is not about being given answers, it is about building the ability to find them yourself.

The result of this practice was that I became much more independent. My leader did not have to spend hours handholding me which also freed his time for bigger responsibilities. I was able to pick up tasks faster and deliver them with more confidence. For the team this meant fewer delays because I was not waiting for someone to explain everything. I could move forward on my own and then validate with others when needed. This small shift created a big impact, I became a reliable team member who could handle challenges even as a fresher.

More importantly this experience built the foundation for my career. The habit of analysing problems, starting with small understanding, and writing down my goals has stayed with me till today. Whether I am working on a new technology, a complex project, or even mentoring others, I still use the same method. It has become my personal formula for learning and problem solving. Many times later in my career when I faced complex situations with clients or new technologies I remembered those early lessons at Polaris. Without that training I may have continued to depend too much on others. With it I built confidence that I could always figure things out no matter how tough they looked at the beginning.

Looking back Polaris was not just my first job, it was the place where I learnt how to learn. That was the biggest gift I could have received at that stage of my career. It shaped my thinking, gave me a method to approach problems, and set me on a path of continuous growth. If I had to describe my learning in simple words I would say it taught me to swim in the sea of challenges instead of waiting for someone to carry me.

‚úÖ This is your **clean version of Part 1** with only full stops and commas.

Would you like me to now draft **Part 2 Scoot Airlines 2015** in the same style with no punctuation except full stops and commas?
